    some **rare treasures**!
  - Colorful CLI will help in better understanding of the things.
  - It can accept multiple files of formnat containing your content like `.txt`, `.docx`,
   `.pdf`(containg text and not text on images).
  - `Find Score` feartures lets you know how much of text in that link matchs yours.
  - Save results in a `.txt` file so you can refer it later.
  - You can store the output which is by default named `results.txt` in the path you wish, 
    - `-o` or `--output` options followed by the desired path will do the trick.
    - `./` is the default directory to store the output.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
